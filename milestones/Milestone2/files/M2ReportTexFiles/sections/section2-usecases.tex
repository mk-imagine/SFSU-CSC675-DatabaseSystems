\section{Use Cases}
\subsection{Use Case 1}
\begin{description}[font=\bfseries\itshape]
\item[Title:]Product Purchase from Website
\item[Actors:]Customer (Leia Organa)
\item[Description:]Leia is someone who is looking for a new circular saw.  She is not happy with the last one she bought since it lacks the feature set she wants.  She wants to browse to see what kind of saws that the website has available.  She finds that there are categories that she can use to limit her search and since the saw is a type of tool, she chooses the tool category.  Nevertheless, tools have a lot more other subcategories, so she continues drilling down the menus until the list is limited to only circular saws.  Now that she has a nice succinct list of saws, she is able to compare them and find the one she wants.

\hspace*{2em}Once found, Leia adds the saw she wants to her shopping cart.  She continues browsing a little longer to see if there is anything else she wants, but decides that she doesn't need anything else and checks out.  After entering in her shipping address and billing address, she chooses a shipping method and completes the transaction.  Once completed, Leia receives an order confirmation email and when the item ships, she receives her receipt with all the relevant shipping details.

\subsection{Use Case 2}
\begin{description}[font=\bfseries\itshape]
\item[Title:]Product Order from Supplier
\item[Actors:]Buyer (Han Solo)
\item[Description:]Han is a buyer for the cutlery category of products at one of the warehouses of our online retailer.  Han's responsibilities include tracking sales and inventory so that he knows exactly what products to buy and when so that the retailer has enough supply to handle demand at any given moment.  There are many suppliers and manufacturers of cutlery, so he needs to ensure that fulfillment of the orders happen in a timely fashion.  If not, he needs to either find another supplier that can fulfill the order or find a substitute item that will satisfy the customers.  With all this in mind, Han logs into the system and checks the inventory of all the cutlery in stock at this warehouse.  He then contacts the supplier and orders many knives to be stocked in the warehouses.  He then enters the pending order in so that he can track the status of it.  Once completed, he continues ordering more cutlery from other vendors until he is sure that the warehouse will continue to have enough supply to handle demand.

\subsection{Use Case 3}
\begin{description}[font=\bfseries\itshape]
\item[Title:]Customer opens an account
\item[Actors:]Customer (Lando Calrissian)
\item[Description:]Lando shops at our online retailer regularly.  Because of this, he wants us to save his information to make his shopping experience more effortless.  He knows that once he opens an account, he can also sign up for our rewards program, where he can redeem points for credit on future purchases.  He is also aware of our premium subscription where he receives free expedited shipping for all his orders, but he is not sure if he wants to pay for this yet since he doesn't really need expedited shipping and all his orders qualify for free ground shipping anyways.

\hspace*{2em}Once he opens his account, he can save multiple shipping addresses and multiple payment methods, which allows him to purchase items quickly and effortlessly. He can also view all his purchase history and track the order status of all his orders.  Once he receives enough points in the rewards program, he can redeem the points for things like gift cards and special discounts or gifts.

\subsection{Use Case 4}
\begin{description}[font=\bfseries\itshape]
\item[Title:]Customer Order is Fulfilled
\item[Actors:]Warehouse Employee (Kylo Ren)
\item[Description:]This use case begins as Kylo goes to his station.  Once there, he logs into his computer terminal which shows him what orders he needs to box up and ship out. The computer terminal gives him the order number with a packing list of all the items to be packed up.  All the work of locating and pulling products has been automated, so his job is to double check the bin prepared by the robots and pack them securely in a box.  If there is an error, it is his responsibility to remove any incorrect products to be returned to the warehouse and request any products that may be missing.  Each of these errors are entered into the terminal along with any corrective action taken.  For example, if the warehouse shows that there is no inventory of a product, he must note that on his terminal so that it can either be fulfilled by another warehouse or notify the customer of a backorder or cancellation.  Once he verifies and packs all the items listed on his terminal, he completes the order by including a packing list inside and labeling the box with the shipping label provided to him.  Once he completes the order, he scans the box and sends it down the conveyor belt to be routed to the correct pickup area of the corresponding courier for delivery.

\subsection{Use Case 5}
\begin{description}[font=\bfseries\itshape]
\item[Title:]Product Return
\item[Actors:]Customer (Boba Fett), Warehouse Employee (Padme Amidala)
\item[Description:]Boba bought a microwave from the online retail store but it arrived broken, so she wants a replacement.  Since he is an account holder, he can log into his account and begin his return process from his order history.  After providing the reason for his return and once the system authorizes his return, he is given options for how he would like the return processed.  He chooses to get a replacement and bring the broken item to a participating brick and mortar retailer to pack and ship the product back because that is most convenient for him.  After completing the transaction, he is provided with a return ID that he is to supply the retailer along with the item to be returned.  He then gives the item to the retailer within the allowable time limit.  The retailer then scans the item, labels the return, and aggregates all the items that were received during the day to be picked up with a contracted courier to be returned to the closest warehouse.  Once the item is scanned, the fulfillment center creates a new order to replace the broken item.

\hspace*{2em}Once the warehouse receives the item, Padme is tasked with finishing the return process.  Padme already is logged into her work terminal.  She takes an item from the bin full of returns and scans it.  Once scanned, the item is flagged as received.  Padme then reviews the product and determines the cause of its inability to operate (i.e. damage from shipment, manufacturer defect, etc).  Once the cause is determined, she enters it into her terminal so that the correct entity is notified and corrective action is taken.
